# Namespot
Generate classroom seating charts and flash cards

# Description
Tool for creating seating charts, flash cards, and name tents.

# Installation
The site uses the Laravel PHP framework, so first head over to www.laravel.com and make sure your server meets the requirements.

```mkdir mynewproject```

```cd mynewproject```

```composer install```
Depending on how you have composer installed, this may instead be ```php composer.phar install```

```npm install```

Set up the .env file with any DB connection credentials you need.

Sometimes when starting a new Laravel project you might have some issues with permissions writing to the log file. I found this thread to be helpful: https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/general-discussion/laravel-framework-file-permission-security/replies/163407

Voila!
